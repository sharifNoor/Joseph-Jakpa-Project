MCU - 1:

Photoresistor 	- On Threshold drop publish MQTT message
Tilt Sensor 	- OnChange publish MQTT message
Push Btn 1 	- OnPress (Servo MCU-2) snaps into place
Push Btn 2 	- OnPress (Laser Diode MCU-2) High
BMS		- have to send battery %age with every MQTT message

MCU - 2:

Laser Diode 	- Depands on (MCU-1 Push Btn 1) Press
Servo 		- Depands on (MCU-1 Push Btn 2) Press
Tilt Sensor	- OnChange publish MQTT message
Photoresistor	- On Threshold drop publish MQTT message
Deep Sleep	- Wakes up when Photoresistor's threshold drops
BMS		- have to send battery %age with every MQTT message
GPS		- have to send GPS Cordinates with every MQTT message

* Communication between both the MCUs will be through LoRa
